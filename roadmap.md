# Feb 22 Roadmap

- do not use c++ exceptions
  - try using [valstat](https://github.com/valstat)
- do not use RTTI
- do not use iostreams
- promote `noexcept` as much as possible
- is it feasible/possible to mandate clang on all platforms?
  - might alienate people for no obvious benefit

- use [utest](https://github.com/sheredom/utest.h)/[ubench](https://github.com/sheredom/ubench.h) as a lighter alternative to catch2
